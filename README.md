# DumoCDN
DumoCDN is a javascript cdn for when JSDelivr is down or you like supporting me.<br />
It fetches the top 3000 packages (which are on NPM, not gh) from JSdelivr and downloads them into the dist folder, then builds the website.<br />
<br />
From experience it takes around 10-30 minutes to download everything, and like 5 seconds to make hte website.
